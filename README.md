This paper explores the dangers of an uneducated society and how those from lower-income communities are disproportionately affected by it based on race, gender, and disabilities. Over the last few years, there has been an outpouring of educators on social media platforms that have time and time again, stated that they are quitting their jobs in droves because of how disruptive and unknowledgeable they are. Libraries are being shut down, and books are being banned throughout the country. Social media and the advances of technology (AI) have a huge impact as and are inhibiting young people's ability to think critically. The sheer amount of ignorance and misinformation that is being shared and documented in news outlets by our government and politicians just validate the decline of critical thinking.

Historically, anti-intellectualism has been used to suppress ideas and manipulate the common people for their designs, which benefits their capitalistic, neopolitical, and religious agendas. The simple definition of anti-intellectualism is a social attitude that systematically denigrates science-based facts, academic and institutional authorities, and the pursuit of theory and knowledge. But Colleen J. Shogan explains it as "Anti-intellectualism" is the attainment of knowledge through instincts, character, moral sensibilities, and emotions. A person who displays ‘anti-intellectual’ qualities disparages the rational complexities associated with intellectual pursuits. Despite these negative opinions, anti-intellectuals are not necessarily unintelligent or dismissive of smart people. Instead, anti-intellectualism is best categorized as a specific type of anti-elitism. Anti-intellectuals exhibit distaste for the smugness and superiority they believe accompanies intellectual life. For anti-intellectuals, the intellectual generates suspicion and cynicism. Intelligence may be valuable and useful, but intellect is dangerous.”

 LITERATURE REVIEW

 The systemic barriers that lower-income communities face, especially students, with the current rise of anti-intellectualism is staggering. Sowing further division and increased polarization, the responsibility of the shift in our culture has much to do with mass media and the rise of AI. Students from the age of kindergarten to high school, even college, cannot read, and are cheating to pass. The education system has perpetuated a cycle of ‘dumbing down’ students, where they are committing a disservice by not holding parents accountable or actually assisting teachers in their endeavors to teach the next generation. This problem only worsened when the population was assigned to stay indoors during the Pandemic.

“In his analysis of Hofstadter, Daniel Rigney (1991) notes that Anti-intellectualism in American Life discusses three types of anti-intellectualism: anti-rationalism, anti-elitism, and unreflective instrumentalism. The third type is evident in the drive for school reform in the United States, in which STEM and other “practical” subjects are privileged over other types of education.”

In November of 2024, The Atlantic published ‘The Elite College Students Who Cannot Read,’ exposing the literacy and mediacy problem that college students attending these elite schools that feels it is impossible to read multiple books during a semester. Worse, those who make it to college has never been assigned by their teachers in middle or high school to finish an entire book. The concept that students who are attending these elite colleges don’t want to read, but that they don’t know how, which is further exacerbated with the rise of technology and social media, and the decline of media literacy. Many social media users, whether it be influencers or regular users, expose that they cannot read or have trouble reading an entire book, or you have to condense an entire book into one trope. American students, compared to their foreign counterparts, rank 36th in global literacy rates, while the National Literary Institute reports that 54% of adults read below a sixth-grade level. Additionally, the National Center for Education Statistics reports a decrease in test scores, but also a widening gap between the high-performing and low-performing students. But while reading does start at home with the responsibility of the parents, and the education system does have its faults as well. The way students have been taught to read has fundamentally changed. The U.S’s education system has changed, as before the 1970s, the use of phonics: matching the sounds of spoken English with individual letters or groups of letters. For example, a word Like ‘bee’, a teacher will take the word, separate the word into its three letters, and pronounce a phone name for each letter in turn, and then blend the phone name into the original word. But then, starting with the 1970s, the system implemented the whole language approach, with the idea that language is learned similarly to speaking, i.e., children will pick it up naturally if exposed to rich language experiences. The whole language approach focuses on understanding the meaning of the word within sentences and stories, rather than breaking down words into phonetic sounds. This approach seems easy to replicate on paper, but not in school settings.
“Many educators, policymakers, and parents question the effectiveness of whole language instruction for the acquisition of the more technical aspects of language: spelling, vocabulary, and grammar as isolated events; rather whole language approach teaches these functions of language contextually. Providing an example of a beginning speller working on writing a sentence, Heald-Taylor(1989) observed: ‘I wt s L nt (‘I went swimming last night') took…more then twenty minutes to write because [the student] labored over each sound (went….wu, etc). Eventually, after working through each phoneme, this student was able to express a meaningful statement. Whole language instructors value phonemic awareness, yet they support this awareness by encouraging students to engage texts through reading and or writing rather than through isolated exercises–The ‘writing drafting’ is seen as much more important than the finished product.”  Brooks, Melanie C., and Jeffrey S. Brooks. “WHOLE LANGUAGE OR PHONICS: IMPROVING LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION THROUGH GENERAL SEMANTICS.” ETC: A Review of General Semantics, vol. 62, no. 3, 2005, pp. 271–80.

Another paper supporting this claim, titled The Literary Decline and Instructional Practices by Dr. Virginia Bonomo states, “In 1967, a review of reading methods was released and the findings were that the phonics approach produced better results in terms of the mechanical aspects of literacy, and also in comprehension and fluency, which is the ultimate goal in teaching reading (Sweet, 1996). Another report in 1985, published by the US Department of Education, confirmed that, ‘Classroom research shows that, on average, children who are taught phonics get off to a better start learning to read than children who are not taught phonics.’ This idea isn’t something new, and has persisted for decades. A lack of literacy skills is a cornerstone of America, and it is not an accident. In 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was signed into law by George Bush. It required annual testing in reading and math for students in grades 3-8 and high school. Schools were held accountable for student performance through 
Adequate Yearly Progress metrics, and heavy penalties were imposed on schools that failed to meet progress goals. Then, NCLB was replaced in 2015 by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) by Barack Obama, which reduced federal control and gave states more flexibility in education. But both policies focused heavily on standardized test scores, which led many schools to focus more on math and reading test prep, and as a result, subjects like science, history, and the Arts were neglected, limiting students' academic growth, as it didn’t improve critical thinking or deeper literary skills. Because of these policies, most schools focused on preparing the students by giving them shorter passages (excerpts) from books to memorize instead of requiring them to actually read. Today, as a result, we are seeing an education system that seems almost like it was designed to fail. Public schools in marginalized communities are poorly funded, which causes a large amount of the American public is either completely uneducated or poorly uneducated.

 THE RISE OF ANTI-EDUCATION SENTIMENT
 
 The U.S., again, has had these attitudes towards ‘intellectuals’ they deem as ‘elitists’. Many prominent figures, corporate leaders, presidents, not excluding Trump, have agreed with this anti-intellectual rhetoric, like President Eisenhower, who spoke on intellectuals, quoted, “[They] take more words than necessary to tell more than he knows.”  This rhetoric has been passed down in the education system, indoctrinating the framework of a 20th-century factory model by wealthy elites John D. Rockefeller and Frederick T. Gates, who established the General Education Board of 1902, which shaped the modern American education system, Intentionally training students in public schools to develop skills that would make them fit to work in factories. Rockefeller, John D. “GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD.” The Journal of Education, vol. 65, no. 7 (1617), 1907, pp. 185–91. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/42815751. Accessed 22 May 2025.

America’s economy solely depends on people who do not have a high-quality education, because inevitably, they will end up being ‘workers’. The less educated someone is, the more susceptible they are to believing in whatever the propaganda the state is telling them, not question what those in power are stating because they don’t have the critical thinking skills. “The relationship between corruption and democracy is a complex one. However, both concepts are closely intertwined. When democracy deteriorates, we can almost certainly expect an increase in corruption due to the erosion of institutional checks and balances, independence of courts and frequent restrictions of the space for civil society actions and political rights of citizens. Likewise, when corruption is not tackled, new democratic states can hardly consolidate. This is especially true of political corruption that plunders the country’s natural resources and widespread petty corruption that impede the ability for citizens to fully enjoy their new political and social rights. Unresolved or increasing corruption can also undermine citizens’ trust in already established democracies and provoke all sorts of citizens' reactions like abstention and distrust, or contribute to other destabilising phenomena like voting for anti-establishment parties and the spread of fake news.”

So, my research question is whether or not anti-intellectualism rhetoric in schools in New York? It is well established that in poorer neighborhoods public schools are well understaffed, underfunded, and attendance rates are at an all time high.


METHODS

Data Source 

This analysis utilized data from the U.S. Census (2022) to explore how anti-intellectualism may be influencing educational outcomes among students in New York. Key variables included race (Black and White populations), high school graduation status (graduates and non-graduates), educational attainment (some college or associate degree, and bachelor’s degree), and median age. All variables were measured across the total population, inclusive of all genders. Initially, a path analysis was considered as the most appropriate analytical framework due to the assumed interrelatedness of variables. However, after further evaluation, an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was determined to be more suitable for this dataset and research question. The shift to regression analysis allowed for a clearer interpretation of how these demographic factors relate to educational attainment, particularly in the context of anti-intellectual attitudes.

Results and Discussion

Using the census I conducted, at first, correlation charts, and then several models for my path analysis. But it seemed like every model I fit, the data became saturated, and did not behave in theory as expected. So, dropping that, I assumed the OLS regression model on whether or not county-level population size predicts the proportion with no high school graduation.

This graph displays that there is no evidence that the county population size predicts the proportion of people with no high school graduation in the data. Another multiple regression model was created, this time with variables of total_race, and white, were included. This model displays that for each additional person in the county, the proportion with no high school graduation decreases by a small amount. So larger counties tend to have a slightly lower proportion of people with no high school graduation, holding the variable (-0.1) prop_white constant. For each -1 unit increases in the proportion of white residents, the proportion with no high school graduation decreases by 0.14, holding the variable total_race constant. Meaning, counties with a higher proportion of white residents have a lower proportion with no highschool graduation.

CONCLUSION

  This paper initially explains the definition of what anti-intellectualism is, and how dangerous it impacts our society, especially towards our students and how it affects the education system. Using the U.S Census of 2022, this study initially explores the relationship between anti-intellectualism and educational attainment across the NY counties. While initial attempts to model these relationships through path analysis proved unproductive due to data saturation and poor theoretical fit, a shift to OLS regression modeling offered more interpretable results. The findings suggest that county-level population size alone does not significantly predict the proportion of residents without a high school diploma. However, when racial composition is taken into account, notable patterns emerge. Specifically, counties with higher proportions of White residents tend to have lower rates of high school non-completion, even after controlling for overall population size. These results point to the complex interplay between race, educational attainment, and broader sociocultural factors that may reflect dimensions of anti-intellectualism. While not definitive, the 
findings underscore the importance of disaggregating demographic data to understand systemic educational disparities. Future research should explore additional variables, such as political ideology, income inequality, and cultural attitudes toward education, to further examine how anti-intellectualism manifests at the community level and affects student outcomes.
